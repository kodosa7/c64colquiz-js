# C64ColQuiz
JavaScript adaptation of a Commodore 64 indie game
by SDW Developments + Privy Software, 2016.  
JavaScript adaptation by ELS, 2022.
Made to practice basic JS during Scrimba course.

## What is it
Match the hex code to the colour on the left or right
before the timer runs out. By that, you can learn C64 colour codes which might by handy  
for all C64 coders and enthusiasts :)  

The timer speeds up every right answer. When 30+ pts  
achieved, it stops increasing as it becomes stupidly crazy.  

Use mouse control.  

Original C64 programming by Andreas Gustafsson.
